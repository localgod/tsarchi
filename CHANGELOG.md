## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Parsing no longer throws on view connections without `xsi:type` (as written by Archi in sketch and canvas models). They default to `Connection` and are saved without the attribute ([#375](https://github.com/localgod/tsarchi/issues/375)).
- Diagram children with multiple `sourceConnection` entries are now parsed and serialized.
- Space-separated `targetConnections` are validated as individual connection ids.
